Title: Real-Time Speech and Text to ISL Translation Website (Contribution to CWASA Project)

Description:

This project involved modifying an existing website developed by CWASA (Center for Writers and Speakers of American Sign Language) to enable real-time speech and text to ISL translation.

mY Contribution:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): I implemented NLP techniques using Python libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) to process spoken or written language and extract meaning. This involved tasks like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and sentiment analysis.
Front-end Development: I utilized Flask (Python web framework) along with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to develop the user interface for the Real Time translation feature,Direct TEXT to animation conversion,etc.
